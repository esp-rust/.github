# ESP-Rust

This organization is a rust playground for Espressif microcontrollers, similar my [esp-cpp](https://github.com/esp-cpp) organization for C++ components and example code. It takes inspiration from [esp-rs](https://github.com/esp-rs) and will likely use some of that code as a starting point.
